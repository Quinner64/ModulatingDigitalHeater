# ModulatingDigitalHeater
ELEC 49X - Capstone Project - Modulating Digital Heater

This project aims to enhance the efficiency and comfort of an existing heater, which currently employs hysteresis control for temperature regulation. Under the current system, the heater activates when the room temperature drops below the designated set temperature (Tset) and deactivates once the temperature rises above Tset + 0.5 degree. This method leads to noticeable temperature fluctuations and increased energy consumption.

The objective of this project is to develop a digital controller that maintains the room temperature precisely at Tset, eliminating any noticeable temperature variance. This controller will be compatible with standard, commercially available heaters, transforming them into highly efficient and comfortable heating solutions.
